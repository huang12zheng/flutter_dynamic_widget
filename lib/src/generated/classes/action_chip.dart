A material design action chip.

Action chips are a set of options which trigger an action related to primary
content. Action chips should appear dynamically and contextually in a UI.

Action chips can be tapped to trigger an action or show progress and
confirmation. They cannot be disabled; if the action is not applicable, the
chip should not be included in the interface. (This contrasts with buttons,
where unavailable choices are usually represented as disabled controls.)

Action chips are displayed after primary content, such as below a card or
persistently at the bottom of a screen.

The material button widgets, [ElevatedButton], [TextButton], and
[OutlinedButton], are an alternative to action chips, which should appear
statically and consistently in a UI.

Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.

{@tool snippet}

```dart
ActionChip(
  avatar: CircleAvatar(
    backgroundColor: Colors.grey.shade800,
    child: Text('AB'),
  ),
  label: Text('Aaron Burr'),
  onPressed: () {
    print("If you stand for nothing, Burr, whatâ€™ll you fall for?");
  }
)
```
{@end-tool}
