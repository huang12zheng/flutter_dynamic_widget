    String get description => r"""
An animation easing curve that passes smoothly through the given control
points using a centripetal Catmull-Rom spline.

When this curve is evaluated with [transform], the values will interpolate
smoothly from one control point to the next, passing through (0.0, 0.0), the
given points, and then (1.0, 1.0).

{@macro flutter.animation.curves.catmull_rom_description}

This class uses a centripetal Catmull-Rom curve (a [CatmullRomSpline]) as
its internal representation. The term centripetal implies that it won't form
loops or self-intersections within a single segment, and corresponds to a
Catmull-Rom Î± (alpha) value of 0.5.
