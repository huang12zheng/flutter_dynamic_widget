    String get description => r"""
A 2D spline that passes smoothly through the given control points using a
centripetal Catmull-Rom spline.

When the curve is evaluated with [transform], the output values will move
smoothly from one control point to the next, passing through the control
points.

{@template flutter.animation.curves.catmull_rom_description}
Unlike most cubic splines, Catmull-Rom splines have the advantage that their
curves pass through the control points given to them. They are cubic
polynomial representations, and, in fact, Catmull-Rom splines can be
converted mathematically into cubic splines. This class implements a
"centripetal" Catmull-Rom spline. The term centripetal implies that it won't
form loops or self-intersections within a single segment.
