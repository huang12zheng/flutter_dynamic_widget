A material design chip.

Chips are compact elements that represent an attribute, text, entity, or
action.

Supplying a non-null [onDeleted] callback will cause the chip to include a
button for deleting the chip.

Its ancestors must include [Material], [MediaQuery], [Directionality], and
[MaterialLocalizations]. Typically all of these widgets are provided by
[MaterialApp] and [Scaffold]. The [label] and [clipBehavior] arguments must
not be null.

{@tool snippet}

```dart
Chip(
avatar: CircleAvatar(
backgroundColor: Colors.grey.shade800,
child: Text('AB'),
),
label: Text('Aaron Burr'),
)
```
{@end-tool}

A material design input chip.

Input chips represent a complex piece of information, such as an entity
(person, place, or thing) or conversational text, in a compact form.

Input chips can be made selectable by setting [onSelected], deletable by
setting [onDeleted], and pressable like a button with [onPressed]. They have
a [label], and they can have a leading icon (see [avatar]) and a trailing
icon ([deleteIcon]). Colors and padding can be customized.

Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.

Input chips work together with other UI elements. They can appear:

* In a [Wrap] widget.
* In a horizontally scrollable list, like a [ListView] whose
scrollDirection is [Axis.horizontal].

{@tool snippet}

```dart
InputChip(
avatar: CircleAvatar(
backgroundColor: Colors.grey.shade800,
child: Text('AB'),
),
label: Text('Aaron Burr'),
onPressed: () {
print('I am the one thing in life.');
}
)

A material design choice chip.

[ChoiceChip]s represent a single choice from a set. Choice chips contain
related descriptive text or categories.

[label] arguments must not be null.

A material design filter chip.

Filter chips use tags or descriptive words as a way to filter content.

Filter chips are a good alternative to [Checkbox] or [Switch] widgets.
Unlike these alternatives, filter chips allow for clearly delineated and
exposed options in a compact area.

Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.

class ActorFilterEntry {
const ActorFilterEntry(this.name, this.initials);
final String name;

A material design action chip.

Action chips are a set of options which trigger an action related to primary
content. Action chips should appear dynamically and contextually in a UI.

Action chips can be tapped to trigger an action or show progress and
confirmation. They cannot be disabled; if the action is not applicable, the
chip should not be included in the interface. (This contrasts with buttons,
where unavailable choices are usually represented as disabled controls.)

Action chips are displayed after primary content, such as below a card or
persistently at the bottom of a screen.

The material button widgets, [ElevatedButton], [TextButton], and
[OutlinedButton], are an alternative to action chips, which should appear
statically and consistently in a UI.

Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.

{@tool snippet}

```dart
ActionChip(
avatar: CircleAvatar(
backgroundColor: Colors.grey.shade800,
child: Text('AB'),
),
label: Text('Aaron Burr'),
onPressed: () {
print("If you stand for nothing, Burr, whatâ€™ll you fall for?");
}
)
```

    @override

A raw material design chip.

This serves as the basis for all of the chip widget types to aggregate.
It is typically not created directly, one of the other chip types
that are appropriate for the use case are used instead:

* [Chip] a simple chip that can only display information and be deleted.
* [InputChip] represents a complex piece of information, such as an entity
(person, place, or thing) or conversational text, in a compact form.
* [ChoiceChip] allows a single selection from a set of options.
* [FilterChip] a chip that uses tags or descriptive words as a way to
filter content.
* [ActionChip]s display a set of actions related to primary content.

Raw chips are typically only used if you want to create your own custom chip
type.

Raw chips can be selected by setting [onSelected], deleted by setting
[onDeleted], and pushed like a button with [onPressed]. They have a [label],
and they can have a leading icon (see [avatar]) and a trailing icon
([deleteIcon]). Colors and padding can be customized.

Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
