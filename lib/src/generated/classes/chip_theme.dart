Applies a chip theme to descendant [RawChip]-based widgets, like [Chip],
[InputChip], [ChoiceChip], [FilterChip], and [ActionChip].

A chip theme describes the color, shape and text styles for the chips it is
applied to.

Descendant widgets obtain the current theme's [ChipThemeData] object using
[ChipTheme.of]. When a widget uses [ChipTheme.of], it is automatically
rebuilt if the theme later changes.

The [ThemeData] object given by the [Theme.of] call also contains a default
[ThemeData.chipTheme] that can be customized by copying it (using
[ChipThemeData.copyWith]).

See also:

 * [Chip], a chip that displays information and can be deleted.
 * [InputChip], a chip that represents a complex piece of information, such
   as an entity (person, place, or thing) or conversational text, in a
   compact form.
 * [ChoiceChip], allows a single selection from a set of options. Choice
   chips contain related descriptive text or categories.
 * [FilterChip], uses tags or descriptive words as a way to filter content.
 * [ActionChip], represents an action related to primary content.
 * [ChipThemeData], which describes the actual configuration of a chip
   theme.
 * [ThemeData], which describes the overall theme information for the
   application.
