    String get description => r"""
A widget that sizes its child to the child's intrinsic height.

This class is useful, for example, when unlimited height is available and
you would like a child that would otherwise attempt to expand infinitely to
instead size itself to a more reasonable height.

The constraints that this widget passes to its child will adhere to the
parent's constraints, so if the constraints are not large enough to satisfy
the child's maximum intrinsic height, then the child will get less height
than it otherwise would. Likewise, if the minimum height constraint is
larger than the child's maximum intrinsic height, the child will be given
more height than it otherwise would.

This class is relatively expensive, because it adds a speculative layout
pass before the final layout phase. Avoid using it where possible. In the
worst case, this widget can result in a layout that is O(NÂ²) in the depth of
the tree.

See also:

 * [Align], a widget that aligns its child within itself. This can be used
   to loosen the constraints passed to the [RenderIntrinsicHeight],
   allowing the [RenderIntrinsicHeight]'s child to be smaller than that of
   its parent.
 * [Column], which when used with [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch] can be used
   to loosen just the height constraints that are passed to the
   [RenderIntrinsicHeight], allowing the [RenderIntrinsicHeight]'s child's
   height to be smaller than that of its parent.
