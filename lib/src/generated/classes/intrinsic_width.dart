A widget that sizes its child to the child's maximum intrinsic width.

This class is useful, for example, when unlimited width is available and
you would like a child that would otherwise attempt to expand infinitely to
instead size itself to a more reasonable width.

The constraints that this widget passes to its child will adhere to the
parent's constraints, so if the constraints are not large enough to satisfy
the child's maximum intrinsic width, then the child will get less width
than it otherwise would. Likewise, if the minimum width constraint is
larger than the child's maximum intrinsic width, the child will be given
more width than it otherwise would.

If [stepWidth] is non-null, the child's width will be snapped to a multiple
of the [stepWidth]. Similarly, if [stepHeight] is non-null, the child's
height will be snapped to a multiple of the [stepHeight].

This class is relatively expensive, because it adds a speculative layout
pass before the final layout phase. Avoid using it where possible. In the
worst case, this widget can result in a layout that is O(NÂ²) in the depth of
the tree.

 * [Align], a widget that aligns its child within itself. This can be used
   to loosen the constraints passed to the [RenderIntrinsicWidth],
   allowing the [RenderIntrinsicWidth]'s child to be smaller than that of
   its parent.
 * [Row], which when used with [CrossAxisAlignment.stretch] can be used
   to loosen just the width constraints that are passed to the
   [RenderIntrinsicWidth], allowing the [RenderIntrinsicWidth]'s child's
   width to be smaller than that of its parent.
