Indicates that the layout of one of the descendants of the object receiving
this notification has changed in some way, and that therefore any
assumptions about that layout are no longer valid.

Useful if, for instance, you're trying to align multiple descendants.

To listen for notifications in a subtree, use a
[NotificationListener<LayoutChangedNotification>].

To send a notification, call [dispatch] on the notification you wish to
send. The notification will be delivered to any [NotificationListener]
widgets with the appropriate type parameters that are ancestors of the given
[BuildContext].

In the widgets library, only the [SizeChangedLayoutNotifier] class and
[Scrollable] classes dispatch this notification (specifically, they dispatch
[SizeChangedLayoutNotification]s and [ScrollNotification]s respectively).
Transitions, in particular, do not. Changing one's layout in one's build
function does not cause this notification to be dispatched automatically. If
an ancestor expects to be notified for any layout change, make sure you
either only use widgets that never change layout, or that notify their
ancestors when appropriate, or alternatively, dispatch the notifications
yourself when appropriate.

Also, since this notification is sent when the layout is changed, it is only
useful for paint effects that depend on the layout. If you were to use this
notification to change the build, for instance, you would always be one
frame behind, which would look really ugly and laggy.
