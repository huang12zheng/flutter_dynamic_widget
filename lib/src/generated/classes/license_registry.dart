A registry for packages to add licenses to, so that they can be displayed
together in an interface such as the [LicensePage].

Packages can register their licenses using [addLicense]. User interfaces
that wish to show all the licenses can obtain them by calling [licenses].

The flutter tool will automatically collect the contents of all the LICENSE
files found at the root of each package into a single LICENSE file in the
default asset bundle. Each license in that file is separated from the next
by a line of eighty hyphens (`-`), and begins with a list of package names
that the license applies to, one to a line, separated from the next by a
blank line. The `services` package registers a license collector that splits
that file and adds each entry to the registry.

The LICENSE files in each package can either consist of a single license, or
can be in the format described above. In the latter case, each component
license and list of package names is merged independently.

 * [showAboutDialog], which shows a Material-style dialog with information
   about the application, including a button that shows a [LicensePage] that
   uses this API to select licenses to show.
 * [AboutListTile], which is a widget that can be added to a [Drawer]. When
   tapped it calls [showAboutDialog].
