Scroll physics that attempt to keep the scroll position in range when the
contents change dimensions suddenly.

If the scroll position is already out of range, this attempts to maintain
the amount of overscroll or underscroll already present.

If the scroll activity is animating the scroll position, sudden changes to
the scroll dimensions are allowed to happen (so as to prevent animations
from jumping back and forth between in-range and out-of-range values).

These physics should be combined with other scroll physics, e.g.
[BouncingScrollPhysics] or [ClampingScrollPhysics], to obtain a complete
description of typical scroll physics. See [applyTo].

## Implementation details

Specifically, these physics perform two adjustments.

The first is to maintain overscroll when the position is out of range.

The second is to enforce the boundary when the position is in range.

If the current velocity is non-zero, neither adjustment is made. The
assumption is that there is an ongoing animation and therefore
further changing the scroll position would disrupt the experience.

If the extents haven't changed, then the overscroll adjustment is
not made. The assumption is that if the position is overscrolled,
it is intentional, otherwise the position could not have reached
that position. (Consider [ClampingScrollPhysics] vs
[BouncingScrollPhysics] for example.)

If the position itself changed since the last animation frame,
then the overscroll is not maintained. The assumption is similar
to the previous case: the position would not have been placed out
of range unless it was intentional.

In addition, if the position changed and the boundaries were and
still are finite, then the boundary isn't enforced either, for
the same reason. However, if any of the boundaries were or are
now infinite, the boundary _is_ enforced, on the assumption that
infinite boundaries indicate a lazy-loading scroll view, which
cannot enforce boundaries while the full list has not loaded.

If the range was out of range, then the boundary is not enforced
even if the range is not maintained. If the range is maintained,
then the distance between the old position and the old boundary is
applied to the new boundary to obtain the new position.

If the range was in range, and the boundary is to be enforced,
then the new position is obtained by deferring to the other physics,
if any, and then clamped to the new range.
