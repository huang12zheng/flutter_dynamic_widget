Render, onto a wheel, a bigger sequential set of objects inside this viewport.

Takes a scrollable set of fixed sized [RenderBox]es and renders them
sequentially from top down on a vertical scrolling axis.

It starts with the first scrollable item in the center of the main axis
and ends with the last scrollable item in the center of the main axis. This
is in contrast to typical lists that start with the first scrollable item
at the start of the main axis and ends with the last scrollable item at the
end of the main axis.

Instead of rendering its children on a flat plane, it renders them
as if each child is broken into its own plane and that plane is
perpendicularly fixed onto a cylinder which rotates along the scrolling
axis.

This class works in 3 coordinate systems:

1. The **scrollable layout coordinates**. This coordinate system is used to
   communicate with [ViewportOffset] and describes its children's abstract
   offset from the beginning of the scrollable list at (0.0, 0.0).

   The list is scrollable from the start of the first child item to the
   start of the last child item.

   Children's layout coordinates don't change as the viewport scrolls.

2. The **untransformed plane's viewport painting coordinates**. Children are
   not painted in this coordinate system. It's an abstract intermediary used
   before transforming into the next cylindrical coordinate system.

   This system is the **scrollable layout coordinates** translated by the
   scroll offset such that (0.0, 0.0) is the top left corner of the
   viewport.

   Because the viewport is centered at the scrollable list's scroll offset
   instead of starting at the scroll offset, there are paintable children
   ~1/2 viewport length before and after the scroll offset instead of ~1
   viewport length after the scroll offset.

   Children's visibility inclusion in the viewport is determined in this
   system regardless of the cylinder's properties such as [diameterRatio]
   or [perspective]. In other words, a 100px long viewport will always
   paint 10-11 visible 10px children if there are enough children in the
   viewport.

3. The **transformed cylindrical space viewport painting coordinates**.
   Children from system 2 get their positions transformed into a cylindrical
   projection matrix instead of its Cartesian offset with respect to the
   scroll offset.

   Children in this coordinate system are painted.

   The wheel's size and the maximum and minimum visible angles are both
   controlled by [diameterRatio]. Children visible in the **untransformed
   plane's viewport painting coordinates**'s viewport will be radially
   evenly laid out between the maximum and minimum angles determined by
   intersecting the viewport's main axis length with a cylinder whose
   diameter is [diameterRatio] times longer, as long as those angles are
   between -pi/2 and pi/2.

   For example, if [diameterRatio] is 2.0 and this [RenderListWheelViewport]
   is 100.0px in the main axis, then the diameter is 200.0. And children
   will be evenly laid out between that cylinder's -arcsin(1/2) and
   arcsin(1/2) angles.

   The cylinder's 0 degree side is always centered in the
   [RenderListWheelViewport]. The transformation from **untransformed
   plane's viewport painting coordinates** is also done such that the child
   in the center of that plane will be mostly untransformed with children
   above and below it being transformed more as the angle increases.
