    String get description => r"""
A sliver that places multiple box children in a linear array along the main
axis.

Each child is forced to have the [SliverConstraints.crossAxisExtent] in the
cross axis but determines its own main axis extent.

[RenderSliverList] determines its scroll offset by "dead reckoning" because
children outside the visible part of the sliver are not materialized, which
means [RenderSliverList] cannot learn their main axis extent. Instead, newly
materialized children are placed adjacent to existing children. If this dead
reckoning results in a logical inconsistency (e.g., attempting to place the
zeroth child at a scroll offset other than zero), the [RenderSliverList]
generates a [SliverGeometry.scrollOffsetCorrection] to restore consistency.

If the children have a fixed extent in the main axis, consider using
[RenderSliverFixedExtentList] rather than [RenderSliverList] because
[RenderSliverFixedExtentList] does not need to perform layout on its
children to obtain their extent in the main axis and is therefore more
efficient.

See also:

 * [RenderSliverFixedExtentList], which is more efficient for children with
   the same extent in the main axis.
 * [RenderSliverGrid], which places its children in arbitrary positions.
