Implements the stack layout algorithm.

In a stack layout, the children are positioned on top of each other in the
order in which they appear in the child list. First, the non-positioned
children (those with null values for top, right, bottom, and left) are
laid out and initially placed in the upper-left corner of the stack. The
stack is then sized to enclose all of the non-positioned children. If there
are no non-positioned children, the stack becomes as large as possible.

The final location of non-positioned children is determined by the alignment
parameter. The left of each non-positioned child becomes the
difference between the child's width and the stack's width scaled by
alignment.x. The top of each non-positioned child is computed
similarly and scaled by alignment.y. So if the alignment x and y properties
are 0.0 (the default) then the non-positioned children remain in the
upper-left corner. If the alignment x and y properties are 0.5 then the
non-positioned children are centered within the stack.

Next, the positioned children are laid out. If a child has top and bottom
values that are both non-null, the child is given a fixed height determined
by subtracting the sum of the top and bottom values from the height of the stack.
Similarly, if the child has right and left values that are both non-null,
the child is given a fixed width derived from the stack's width.
Otherwise, the child is given unbounded constraints in the non-fixed dimensions.

Once the child is laid out, the stack positions the child
according to the top, right, bottom, and left properties of their
[StackParentData]. For example, if the bottom value is 10.0, the
bottom edge of the child will be inset 10.0 pixels from the bottom
edge of the stack. If the child extends beyond the bounds of the
stack, the stack will clip the child's painting to the bounds of
the stack.
