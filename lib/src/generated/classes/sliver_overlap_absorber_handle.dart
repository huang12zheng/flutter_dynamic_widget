Handle to provide to a [SliverOverlapAbsorber], a [SliverOverlapInjector],
and an [NestedScrollViewViewport], to shift overlap in a [NestedScrollView].

A particular [SliverOverlapAbsorberHandle] can only be assigned to a single
[SliverOverlapAbsorber] at a time. It can also be (and normally is) assigned
to one or more [SliverOverlapInjector]s, which must be later descendants of
the same [NestedScrollViewViewport] as the [SliverOverlapAbsorber]. The
[SliverOverlapAbsorber] must be a direct descendant of the
[NestedScrollViewViewport], taking part in the same sliver layout. (The
[SliverOverlapInjector] can be a descendant that takes part in a nested
scroll view's sliver layout.)

Whenever the [NestedScrollViewViewport] is marked dirty for layout, it will
cause its assigned [SliverOverlapAbsorberHandle] to fire notifications. It
is the responsibility of the [SliverOverlapInjector]s (and any other
clients) to mark themselves dirty when this happens, in case the geometry
subsequently changes during layout.

 * [NestedScrollView], which uses a [NestedScrollViewViewport] and a
   [SliverOverlapAbsorber] to align its children, and which shows sample
   usage for this class.
