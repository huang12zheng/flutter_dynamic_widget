Defines the strut, which sets the minimum height a line can be
relative to the baseline.

Strut applies to all lines in the paragraph. Strut is a feature that
allows minimum line heights to be set. The effect is as if a zero
width space was included at the beginning of each line in the
paragraph. This imaginary space is 'shaped' according the properties
defined in this class. Flutter's strut is based on
[typesetting strut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strut_(typesetting))
and CSS's [line-height](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#line-height).

No lines may be shorter than the strut. The ascent and descent of the
strut are calculated, and any laid out text that has a shorter ascent or
descent than the strut's ascent or descent will take the ascent and
descent of the strut. Text with ascents or descents larger than the
strut's ascent or descent will layout as normal and extend past the strut.

Strut is defined independently from any text content or [TextStyle]s.

The vertical components of strut are as follows:

 * Half the font-defined leading
 * `ascent * height`
 * `descent * height`
 * Half the font-defined leading

The sum of these four values is the total height of the line.

Ascent is the font's spacing above the baseline without leading and
descent is the spacing below the baseline without leading. Leading is
split evenly between the top and bottom. The values for `ascent` and
`descent` are provided by the font named by [fontFamily]. If no
[fontFamily] or [fontFamilyFallback] is provided, then the platform's
default family will be used. Many fonts will have leading values of
zero, so in practice, the leading component is often irrelevant.

When [height] is omitted or null, then the font defined ascent and descent
will be used. The font's combined ascent and descent may be taller or
shorter than the [fontSize]. When [height] is provided, the line's EM-square
ascent and descent (which sums to [fontSize]) will be scaled by [height] to
achieve a final line height of `fontSize * height + fontSize * leading`
logical pixels. The proportion of ascent:descent with [height] specified
is the same as the font metrics defined ascent:descent ratio.

![Text height diagram](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_height_diagram.png)

Each line's spacing above the baseline will be at least as tall as the
half leading plus ascent. Each line's spacing below the baseline will
be at least as tall as the half leading plus descent.

### Fields and their default values.

Omitted or null properties will take the default values specified below:

 * [fontFamily]: the name of the font to use when calculating the strut
   (e.g., Roboto). No glyphs from the font will be drawn and the font will
   be used purely for metrics.

 * [fontFamilyFallback]: an ordered list of font family names that will
   be searched for when the font in [fontFamily] cannot be found. When
   all specified font families have been exhausted an no match was found,
   the default platform font will be used.

 * [fontSize]: the size of the ascent plus descent in logical pixels. This
   is also used as the basis of the custom leading calculation. This value
   cannot be negative.
   Default is 14 logical pixels.

 * [height]: the multiple of [fontSize] the line's height should be.
   The line's height will take the font's ascent and descent values if
   [height] is omitted or null. If provided, the EM-square ascent and
   descent (which sum to [fontSize]) is scaled by [height].
   The [height] will impact the spacing above and below the baseline
   differently depending on the ratios between the font's ascent and
   descent. This property is separate from the leading multiplier, which
   is controlled through [leading].
   Default is null.

 * [leading]: the custom leading to apply to the strut as a multiple of
   [fontSize]. Leading is additional spacing between lines. Half of the
   leading is added to the top and the other half to the bottom of the
   line height. This differs from [height] since the spacing is equally
   distributed above and below the baseline.
   Default is null, which will use the font-specified leading.

 * [fontWeight]: the typeface thickness to use when calculating the strut
   (e.g., bold).
   Default is [FontWeight.w400].

 * [fontStyle]: the typeface variant to use when calculating the strut
   (e.g., italic).
   Default is [FontStyle.normal].

 * [forceStrutHeight]: when true, all lines will be laid out with the
   height of the strut. All line and run-specific metrics will be
   ignored/overridden and only strut metrics will be used instead.
   This property guarantees uniform line spacing, however text in
   adjacent lines may overlap. This property should be enabled with
   caution as it bypasses a large portion of the vertical layout system.
   The default value is false.

### Examples

{@tool snippet}
In this simple case, the text will be rendered at font size 10, however,
the vertical height of each line will be the strut height (Roboto in
font size 30 * 1.5) as the text itself is shorter than the strut.

```dart
const Text(
  'Hello, world!\nSecond line!',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 10,
    fontFamily: 'Raleway',
  ),
  strutStyle: StrutStyle(
    fontFamily: 'Roboto',
    fontSize: 30,
    height: 1.5,
  ),
),
```
{@end-tool}

{@tool snippet}
Here, strut is used to absorb the additional line height in the second line.
The strut [height] was defined as 1.5 (the default font size is 14), which
caused all lines to be laid out taller than without strut. This extra space
was able to accommodate the larger font size of `Second line!` without
causing the line height to change for the second line only. All lines in
this example are thus the same height (`14 * 1.5`).

```dart
const Text.rich(
  TextSpan(
    text: 'First line!\n',
    style: TextStyle(
      fontSize: 14,
      fontFamily: 'Roboto'
    ),
    children: <TextSpan>[
      TextSpan(
        text: 'Second line!\n',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 16,
          fontFamily: 'Roboto',
        ),
      ),
      TextSpan(
        text: 'Third line!\n',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 14,
          fontFamily: 'Roboto',
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
  strutStyle: StrutStyle(
    fontFamily: 'Roboto',
    height: 1.5,
  ),
),
```
{@end-tool}

{@tool snippet}
Here, strut is used to enable strange and overlapping text to achieve unique
effects. The `M`s in lines 2 and 3 are able to extend above their lines and
fill empty space in lines above. The [forceStrutHeight] is enabled and functions
as a 'grid' for the glyphs to draw on.

```dart
const Text.rich(
  TextSpan(
    text: '---------         ---------\n',
    style: TextStyle(
      fontSize: 14,
      fontFamily: 'Roboto',
    ),
    children: <TextSpan>[
      TextSpan(
        text: '^^^M^^^\n',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 30,
          fontFamily: 'Roboto',
        ),
      ),
      TextSpan(
        text: 'M------M\n',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 30,
          fontFamily: 'Roboto',
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
  strutStyle: StrutStyle(
    fontFamily: 'Roboto',
    fontSize: 14,
    height: 1,
    forceStrutHeight: true,
  ),
),
```
{@end-tool}

{@tool snippet}
This example uses forceStrutHeight to create a 'drop cap' for the 'T' in 'The'.
By locking the line heights to the metrics of the 14pt serif font, we are able
to lay out a large 37pt 'T' on the second line to take up space on both the first
and second lines.
