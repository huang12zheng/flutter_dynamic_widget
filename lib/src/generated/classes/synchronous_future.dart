A [Future] whose [then] implementation calls the callback immediately.

This is similar to [new Future.value], except that the value is available in
the same event-loop iteration.

âš  This class is useful in cases where you want to expose a single API, where
you normally want to have everything execute synchronously, but where on
rare occasions you want the ability to switch to an asynchronous model. **In
general use of this class should be avoided as it is very difficult to debug
such bimodal behavior.**
