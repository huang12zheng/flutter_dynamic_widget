An immutable style describing how to format and paint text.

### Bold

{@tool snippet}
Here, a single line of text in a [Text] widget is given a specific style
override. The style is mixed with the ambient [DefaultTextStyle] by the
[Text] widget.

![Applying the style in this way creates bold text.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_bold.png)

```dart
Text(
  'No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan.',
  style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
)
```
{@end-tool}

### Italics

{@tool snippet}
As in the previous example, the [Text] widget is given a specific style
override which is implicitly mixed with the ambient [DefaultTextStyle].

![This results in italicized text.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_italics.png)

```dart
Text(
  "Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation.",
  style: TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic),
)
```
{@end-tool}

### Opacity and Color

Each line here is progressively more opaque. The base color is
[material.Colors.black], and [Color.withOpacity] is used to create a
derivative color with the desired opacity. The root [TextSpan] for this
[RichText] widget is explicitly given the ambient [DefaultTextStyle], since
[RichText] does not do that automatically. The inner [TextStyle] objects are
implicitly mixed with the parent [TextSpan]'s [TextSpan.style].

If [color] is specified, [foreground] must be null and vice versa. [color] is
treated as a shorthand for `Paint()..color = color`.

If [backgroundColor] is specified, [background] must be null and vice versa.
The [backgroundColor] is treated as a shorthand for
`background: Paint()..color = backgroundColor`.

![This results in three lines of text that go from lighter to darker in color.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_opacity_and_color.png)

```dart
RichText(
  text: TextSpan(
    style: DefaultTextStyle.of(context).style,
    children: <TextSpan>[
      TextSpan(
        text: "You don't have the votes.\n",
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.6)),
      ),
      TextSpan(
        text: "You don't have the votes!\n",
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.8)),
      ),
      TextSpan(
        text: "You're gonna need congressional approval and you don't have the votes!\n",
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(1.0)),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### Size

{@tool snippet}
In this example, the ambient [DefaultTextStyle] is explicitly manipulated to
obtain a [TextStyle] that doubles the default font size.

![This results in text that is twice as large as normal.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_size.png)

```dart
Text(
  "These are wise words, enterprising men quote 'em.",
  style: DefaultTextStyle.of(context).style.apply(fontSizeFactor: 2.0),
)
```
{@end-tool}

### Line height

By default, text will layout with line height as defined by the font.
Font-metrics defined line height may be taller or shorter than the font size.
The [height] property allows manual adjustment of the height of the line as
a multiple of [fontSize]. For most fonts, setting [height] to 1.0 is not
the same as omitting or setting height to null. The following diagram
illustrates the difference between the font-metrics defined line height and
the line height produced with `height: 1.0` (also known as the EM-square):

![Text height diagram](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_height_diagram.png)

{@tool snippet}
The [height] property can be used to change the line height. Here, the line
height is set to 5 times the font size, so that the text is very spaced out.
Since the `fontSize` is set to 10, the final height of the line is
50 pixels.

```dart
Text(
  'Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but youâ€™re here with us in New York City.',
  style: TextStyle(height: 5, fontSize: 10),
)
```
{@end-tool}

Examples of the resulting heights from different values of `TextStyle.height`:

See [StrutStyle] for further control of line height at the paragraph level.

### Wavy red underline with black text

{@tool snippet}
Styles can be combined. In this example, the misspelled word is drawn in
black text and underlined with a wavy red line to indicate a spelling error.
(The remainder is styled according to the Flutter default text styles, not
the ambient [DefaultTextStyle], since no explicit style is given and
[RichText] does not automatically use the ambient [DefaultTextStyle].)

![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_wavy_red_underline.png)

```dart
RichText(
  text: TextSpan(
    text: "Don't tax the South ",
    children: <TextSpan>[
      TextSpan(
        text: 'cuz',
        style: TextStyle(
          color: Colors.black,
          decoration: TextDecoration.underline,
          decorationColor: Colors.red,
          decorationStyle: TextDecorationStyle.wavy,
        ),
      ),
      TextSpan(
        text: ' we got it made in the shade',
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```
{@end-tool}

### Borders and stroke (Foreground)

{@tool snippet}
To create bordered text, a [Paint] with [Paint.style] set to [PaintingStyle.stroke]
should be provided as a [foreground] paint. The following example uses a [Stack]
to produce a stroke and fill effect.

![Text border](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/text_border.png)

```dart
Stack(
  children: <Widget>[
    // Stroked text as border.
    Text(
      'Greetings, planet!',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 40,
        foreground: Paint()
          ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
          ..strokeWidth = 6
          ..color = Colors.blue[700],
      ),
    ),
    // Solid text as fill.
    Text(
      'Greetings, planet!',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 40,
        color: Colors.grey[300],
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```
{@end-tool}

### Gradients (Foreground)

{@tool snippet}
The [foreground] property also allows effects such as gradients to be
applied to the text. Here we provide a [Paint] with a [ui.Gradient]
shader.

![Text gradient](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/text_gradient.png)

```dart
Text(
  'Greetings, planet!',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 40,
    foreground: Paint()
      ..shader = ui.Gradient.linear(
        const Offset(0, 20),
        const Offset(150, 20),
        <Color>[
          Colors.red,
          Colors.yellow,
        ],
      )
  ),
)
```
{@end-tool}

### Custom Fonts

Custom fonts can be declared in the `pubspec.yaml` file as shown below:

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
     - family: Schyler
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
         - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
           style: italic
```

The `family` property determines the name of the font, which you can use in
the [fontFamily] argument. The `asset` property is a path to the font file,
relative to the `pubspec.yaml` file. The `weight` property specifies the
weight of the glyph outlines in the file as an integer multiple of 100
between 100 and 900. This corresponds to the [FontWeight] class and can be
used in the [fontWeight] argument. The `style` property specifies whether the
outlines in the file are `italic` or `normal`. These values correspond to
the [FontStyle] class and can be used in the [fontStyle] argument.

To select a custom font, create [TextStyle] using the [fontFamily]
argument as shown in the example below:

{@tool snippet}
![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/painting/text_style_custom_fonts.png)

```dart
const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway')
```
{@end-tool}

To use a font family defined in a package, the `package` argument must be
provided. For instance, suppose the font declaration above is in the
`pubspec.yaml` of a package named `my_package` which the app depends on.
Then creating the TextStyle is done as follows:

```dart
const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway', package: 'my_package')
```

If the package internally uses the font it defines, it should still specify
the `package` argument when creating the text style as in the example above.

A package can also provide font files without declaring a font in its
`pubspec.yaml`. These files should then be in the `lib/` folder of the
package. The font files will not automatically be bundled in the app, instead
the app can use these selectively when declaring a font. Suppose a package
named `my_package` has:

```
lib/fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
```

Then the app can declare a font like in the example below:

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: packages/my_package/fonts/Raleway-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
```

The `lib/` is implied, so it should not be included in the asset path.

In this case, since the app locally defines the font, the TextStyle is
created without the `package` argument:

{@tool snippet}
```dart
const TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway')
```
{@end-tool}

### Custom Font Fallback

A custom [fontFamilyFallback] list can be provided. The list should be an
ordered list of strings of font family names in the order they will be attempted.

The fonts in [fontFamilyFallback] will be used only if the requested glyph is
not present in the [fontFamily].

The fallback order is:

 * [fontFamily]
 * [fontFamilyFallback] in order of first to last.
 * System fallback fonts which will vary depending on platform.

The glyph used will always be the first matching version in fallback order.

The [fontFamilyFallback] property is commonly used to specify different font
families for multilingual text spans as well as separate fonts for glyphs such
as emojis.

{@tool snippet}
In the following example, any glyphs not present in the font `Raleway` will be attempted
to be resolved with `Noto Sans CJK SC`, and then with `Noto Color Emoji`:

```dart
const TextStyle(
  fontFamily: 'Raleway',
  fontFamilyFallback: <String>[
    'Noto Sans CJK SC',
    'Noto Color Emoji',
  ],
)
```
{@end-tool}

If all custom fallback font families are exhausted and no match was found
or no custom fallback was provided, the platform font fallback will be used.

### Inconsistent platform fonts

Since Flutter's font discovery for default fonts depends on the fonts present
on the device, it is not safe to assume all default fonts will be available or
consistent across devices.

A known example of this is that Samsung devices ship with a CJK font that has
smaller line spacing than the Android default. This results in Samsung devices
displaying more tightly spaced text than on other Android devices when no
custom font is specified.

To avoid this, a custom font should be specified if absolute font consistency
is required for your application.
